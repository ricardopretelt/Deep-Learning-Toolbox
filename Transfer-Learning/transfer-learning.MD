## Description

The [code](Cat-Dog-Classifier.ipynb) serves as boilerplate and guide when it is needed for a neural network that uses transfer learning to classify images. The model used for transfer is DenseNet121. The database comes from [udacity](https://www.udacity.com) with folders for training and testing.

I did it on my own but with instructions from [udacity](https://www.udacity.com) for their pytorch course. You can find more about it in their [github](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/intro-to-pytorch)

## Tools & Dependencies

Other python libraries used are:
* Matplotlib
* Torchvision
* Numpy
* Pytorch
