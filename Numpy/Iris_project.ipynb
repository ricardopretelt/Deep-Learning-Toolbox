    "[The Iris Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) can be found in the scikit-learn library. See more information in the official documentation. It consitss of 3 different types of irises (targer variables to classify): Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica, but for simplicity just the data for the first 2 are used. The characteristics (Inputs of the model) are: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.\n",
    "The model is created just using base python and numpy. sklearn is used to download the dataset and to divide it in training and test data. The goal is to create a deep learning model of a neural network using the most basic tools of python without any platform as tensorflow or pytorch to understand deeply all the parts in the architecture."
