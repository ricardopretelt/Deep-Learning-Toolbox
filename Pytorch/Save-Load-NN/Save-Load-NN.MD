## Description

The [code](NN-model.ipynb) serves as boilerplate and guide when it is needed to save or load a NN model in pytorch. This way the time used to train multiple times a model can be saved. For the example it is used a database of simplified images of clothes called `Fashion-MNIST`. It is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Description from [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

I did it on my own but with instructions from [udacity](https://www.udacity.com) for their pytorch course. You can find more about it in their [github](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/intro-to-pytorch)
